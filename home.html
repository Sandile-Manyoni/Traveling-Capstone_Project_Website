               <h2>Travel with me to Maldives</h2>
               <p class="=p1">The Maldives are the ideal destination for lovers of wild landscapes, 
                with an archipelago of more than a thousand islands spread over 800 km of coastline. 
                They are made up of 22 atolls, 
                these low coral islands typical of the oceans in the shape of a necklace.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Maldives are the stuff dreams are made of - as in dream vacations inspired by those impossibly perfect pictures you've seen,
                     or those pesky fantasies about quitting your day job to live on an exotic island for the rest of your life. 
                     You know, the places that can't possibly live up to your expectations of beauty and wonder. 
                     Well, we found out that the Maldives actually does live up to every single expectation. 
                     It looks exactly like those stock images floating across your screen: bright sun, transparent blue lagoons, 
                     house reefs teeming with fish, low waters with baby reef sharks and rays, 
                     and white sand beaches that stretch out into nothing but miles and miles of turquoise waters and blue skies.
